This document specifies th`_.Rÿe DoD Standard Internet Protocol.  This
document is based on six earlier editions of the ARPA Internet Protocol
Specification, and the present text draws heavily from them.  There have
been many contributors to this work both in terms of concepts and in
te`_.Rÿrms of text.  This edition revises aspects of addressing, error
handling, option codes, and the security, precedence, compartments, and
handling restriction features of the internet protocol.

                           INTERNET PROTOCOL

                         DARPA INTERNET PROGRAM
                         PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION



                            1. `_.Rÿ INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Motivation

  The Internet Protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems of
  packet-switched computer communication networks.  Such a system has
  been called a "catenet" [1].  The internet protocol provides for
  transmittin`_.Rÿg blocks of data called datagrams from sources to
  destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by
  fixed length addresses.  The internet protocol also provides for
  fragmentation and reassembly of long datagrams, if necessary, for
`_.Rÿ  transmission through "small packet" networks.

1.2.  Scope

  The internet protocol is specifically limited in scope to provide the
  functions necessary to deliver a package of bits (an internet
  datagram) from a source to a destination over an interco`_.Rÿnnected system
  of networks.  There are no mechanisms to augment end-to-end data
  reliability, flow control, sequencing, or other services commonly
  found in host-to-host protocols.  The internet protocol can capitalize
  on the services of its supporti`_.Rÿng networks to provide various types
  and qualities of service.

1.3.  Interfaces

  This protocol is called on by host-to-host protocols in an internet
  environment.  This protocol calls on local network protocols to carry
  the internet datagram to the`_.Rÿ next gateway or destination host.

  For example, a TCP module would call on the internet module to take a
  TCP segment (including the TCP header and user data) as the data
  portion of an internet datagram.  The TCP module would provide the
  addresses `_.Rÿand other parameters in the internet header to the internet
  module as arguments of the call.  The internet module would then
  create an internet datagram and call on the local network interface to
  transmit the internet datagram.

  In the ARPANET case`_.Rÿ, for example, the internet module would call on a


                                                                [Page 1]

Internet Protocol
Introduction



  local net module w`_.Rÿhich would add the 1822 leader [2] to the internet
  datagram creating an ARPANET message to transmit to the IMP.  The
  ARPANET address would be derived from the internet address by the
  local network interface and would be the address of some host in th`_.Rÿe
  ARPANET, that host might be a gateway to other networks.

1.4.  Operation

  The internet protocol implements two basic functions:  addressing and
  fragmentation.

  The internet modules use the addresses carried in the internet header
  to transmit i`_.Rÿnternet datagrams toward their destinations.  The
  selection of a path for transmission is called routing.

  The internet modules use fields in the internet header to fragment and
  reassemble internet datagrams when necessary for transmission through
  `_.Rÿ"small packet" networks.

  The model of operation is that an internet module resides in each host
  engaged in internet communication and in each gateway that
  interconnects networks.  These modules share common rules for
  interpreting address fields an`_.Rÿd for fragmenting and assembling
  internet datagrams.  In addition, these modules (especially in
  gateways) have procedures for making routing decisions and other
  functions.

  The internet protocol treats each internet datagram as an independent
  ent`_.Rÿity unrelated to any other internet datagram.  There are no
  connections or logical circuits (virtual or otherwise).

  The internet protocol uses four key mechanisms in providing its
  service:  Type of Service, Time to Live, Options, and Header Checksum`_.Rÿ.

  The Type of Service is used to indicate the quality of the service
  desired.  The type of service is an abstract or generalized set of
  parameters which characterize the service choices provided in the
  networks that make up the internet.  This typ`_.Rÿe of service indication
  is to be used by gateways to select the actual transmission parameters
  for a particular network, the network to be used for the next hop, or
  the next gateway when routing an internet datagram.

  The Time to Live is an indicat`_.Rÿion of an upper bound on the lifetime of
  an internet datagram.  It is set by the sender of the datagram and
  reduced at the points along the route where it is processed.  If the
  time to live reaches zero before the internet datagram reaches its
  dest`_.Rÿination, the internet datagram is destroyed.  The time to live can
  be thought of as a self destruct time limit.

                                                            Introduction



  The Options provide for control functions needed or useful in some
  situations but unnecessary `_.Rÿfor the most common communications.  The
  options include provisions for timestamps, security, and special
  routing.

  The Header Checksum provides a verification that the information used
  in processing internet datagram has been transmitted correctly`_.Rÿ.  The
  data may contain errors.  If the header checksum fails, the internet
  datagram is discarded at once by the entity which detects the error.

  The internet protocol does not provide a reliable communication
  facility.  There are no acknowledgment`_.Rÿs either end-to-end or
  hop-by-hop.  There is no error control for data, only a header
  checksum.  There are no retransmissions.  There is no flow control.

  Errors detected may be reported via the Internet Control Message
  Protocol (ICMP) [3] which is`_.Rÿ implemented in the internet protocol
  module.

                               Figure 1.

  Internet protocol interfaces on one side to the higher level
  host-to-host protocols and on the other side to th`_.Rÿe local network
  protocol.  In this context a "local network" may be a small network in
  a building or a large network such as the ARPANET.

2.2.  Model of Operation

  The  model of operation for transmitting a datagram from one
  application program to`_.Rÿ another is illustrated by the following
  scenario:

    We suppose that this transmission will involve one intermediate
    gateway.

    The sending application program prepares its data and calls on its
    local internet module to send that data as a `_.Rÿdatagram and passes the
    destination address and other parameters as arguments of the call.

    The internet module prepares a datagram header and attaches the data
    to it.  The internet module determines a local network address for
    this interne`_.Rÿt address, in this case it is the address of a gateway.


                                                                [Page 5]

Internet Protocol
Overview



    It sends this d`_.Rÿatagram and the local network address to the local
    network interface.

    The local network interface creates a local network header, and
    attaches the datagram to it, then sends the result via the local
    network.

    The datagram arrives at a `_.Rÿgateway host wrapped in the local network
    header, the local network interface strips off this header, and
    turns the datagram over to the internet module.  The internet module
    determines from the internet address that the datagram is to be
    f`_.Rÿorwarded to another host in a second network.  The internet module
    determines a local net address for the destination host.  It calls
    on the local network interface for that network to send the
    datagram.

    This local network interface create`_.Rÿs a local network header and
    attaches the datagram sending the result to the destination host.

    At this destination host the datagram is stripped of the local net
    header by the local network interface and handed to the internet
    module.

   `_.Rÿ The internet module determines that the datagram is for an
    application program in this host.  It passes the data to the
    application program in response to a system call, passing the source
    address and other parameters as results of the call.

2.3.  Function Description

  The funct`_.Rÿion or purpose of Internet Protocol is to move datagrams
  through an interconnected set of networks.  This is done by passing
  the datagrams from one internet module to another until the
  destination is reached.  The internet modules reside in hosts and`_.Rÿ
  gateways in the internet system.  The datagrams are routed from one
  internet module to another through individual networks based on the
  interpretation of an internet address.  Thus, one important mechanism
  of the internet protocol is the internet `_.Rÿaddress.

  In the routing of messages from one internet module to another,
  datagrams may need to traverse a network whose maximum packet size is
  smaller than the size of the datagram.  To overcome this difficulty, a
  fragmentation mechanism is provid`_.Rÿed in the internet protocol.

  Addressing

    A distinction is made between names, addresses, and routes [4].   A
    name indicates what we seek.  An address indicates where it is.  A
    route indicates how to get there.  The internet protocol deals
  `_.Rÿ  primarily with addresses.  It is the task of higher level (i.e.,
    host-to-host or application) protocols to make the mapping from
    names to addresses.   The internet module maps internet addresses to
    local net addresses.  It is the task of lowe`_.Rÿr level (i.e., local net
    or gateways) procedures to make the mapping from local net addresses
    to routes.

    Addresses are fixed length of four octets (32 bits).  An address
    begins with a network number, followed by local address (called the
 `_.Rÿ   "rest" field).  There are three formats or classes of internet
    addresses:  in class a, the high order bit is zero, the next 7 bits
    are the network, and the last 24 bits are the local address; in
    class b, the high order two bits are one-zero,`_.Rÿ the next 14 bits are
    the network and the last 16 bits are the local address; in class c,
    the high order three bits are one-one-zero, the next 21 bits are the
    network and the last 8 bits are the local address.

    Care must be taken in mapping`_.Rÿ internet addresses to local net
    addresses; a single physical host must be able to act as if it were
    several distinct hosts to the extent of using several distinct
    internet addresses.  Some hosts will also have several physical
    interfaces (`_.Rÿmulti-homing).

    That is, provision must be made for a host to have several physical
    interfaces to the network with each having several logical internet
    addresses.



                                                                [Page 7]

Internet Protocol
Overview



    Examples of address mappings may be found in "Address Mappings" [5].

  Fragmentation

    Fragmentation of an internet datagram is necessary when it
 `_.Rÿ   originates in a local net that allows a large packet size and must
    traverse a local net that limits packets to a smaller size to reach
    its destination.

    An internet datagram can be marked "don't fragment."  Any internet
    datagram so marke`_.Rÿd is not to be internet fragmented under any
    circumstances.  If internet datagram marked don't fragment cannot be
    delivered to its destination without fragmenting it, it is to be
    discarded instead.

    Fragmentation, transmission and reassembl`_.Rÿy across a local network
    which is invisible to the internet protocol module is called
    intranet fragmentation and may be used [6].

    The internet fragmentation and reassembly procedure needs to be able
    to break a datagram into an almost arbit`_.Rÿrary number of pieces that
    can be later reassembled.  The receiver of the fragments uses the
    identification field to ensure that fragments of different datagrams
    are not mixed.  The fragment offset field tells the receiver the
    position of a`_.Rÿ fragment in the original datagram.  The fragment
    offset and length determine the portion of the original datagram
    covered by this fragment.  The more-fragments flag indicates (by
    being reset) the last fragment.  These fields provide sufficient`_.Rÿ
    information to reassemble datagrams.

    The identification field is used to distinguish the fragments of one
    datagram from those of another.  The originating protocol module of
    an internet datagram sets the identification field to a value th`_.Rÿat
    must be unique for that source-destination pair and protocol for the
    time the datagram will be active in the internet system.  The
    originating protocol module of a complete datagram sets the
    more-fragments flag to zero and the fragment o`_.Rÿffset to zero.

    To fragment a long internet datagram, an internet protocol module
    (for example, in a gateway), creates two new internet datagrams and
    copies the contents of the internet header fields from the long
    datagram into both new int`_.Rÿernet headers.  The data of the long
    datagram is divided into two portions on a 8 octet (64 bit) boundary
    (the second portion might not be an integral multiple of 8 octets,
    but the first must be).  Call the number of 8 octet blocks in the
    f`_.Rÿirst portion NFB (for Number of Fragment Blocks).  The first
    portion of the data is placed in the first new internet datagram,
    and the total length field is set to the length of the first

    datagram.  The more-fragments flag is set to one.  The second
    portion of the data is placed in the second new internet datagram,`_.Rÿ
    and the total length field is set to the length of the second
    datagram.  The more-fragments flag carries the same value as the
    long datagram.  The fragment offset field of the second new internet
    datagram is set to the value of that field `_.Rÿin the long datagram plus
    NFB.

    This procedure can be generalized for an n-way split, rather than
    the two-way split described.

    To assemble the fragments of an internet datagram, an internet
    protocol module (for example at a destination`_.Rÿ host) combines
    internet datagrams that all have the same value for the four fields:
    identification, source, destination, and protocol.  The combination
    is done by placing the data portion of each fragment in the relative
    position indicated`_.Rÿ by the fragment offset in that fragment's
    internet header.  The first fragment will have the fragment offset
    zero, and the last fragment will have the more-fragments flag reset
    to zero.

2.4.  Gateways

  Gateways implement internet protocol t`_.Rÿo forward datagrams between
  networks.  Gateways also implement the Gateway to Gateway Protocol
  (GGP) [7] to coordinate routing and other internet control
  information.

  In a gateway the higher level protocols need not be implemented and
  the GGP fu`_.Rÿnctions are added to the IP module.

  Type of Service:  8 bits

    The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract
    parameters of the quality of service desired.  These parameters are
    to`_.Rÿ be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters
    when transmitting a datagram through a particular network.  Several
    networks offer service precedence, which somehow treats high
    precedence traffic as more important than other tr`_.Rÿaffic (generally
    by accepting only traffic above a certain precedence at time of high
    load).  The major choice is a three way tradeoff between low-delay,
    high-reliability, and high-throughput.

      Bits 0-2:  Precedence.
      Bit    3:  0 = `_.RÿNormal Delay,      1 = Low Delay.
      Bits   4:  0 = Normal Throughput, 1 = High Throughput.
      Bits   5:  0 = Normal Relibility, 1 = High Relibility.
      Bit  6-7:  Reserved for Future Use.

    The use of the Delay, Throughput, and Reliability indications may
    increase the cost (in some sense) of the service.  In many networks
    better performance for one of these parameters is coupled with worse
    performance on another.  Ex`_.Rÿcept for very unusual cases at most two
    of these three indications should be set.

    The type of service is used to specify the treatment of the datagram
    during its transmission through the internet system.  Example
    mappings of the internet t`_.Rÿype of service to the actual service
    provided on networks such as AUTODIN II, ARPANET, SATNET, and PRNET
    is given in "Service Mappings" [8].

    The Network Control precedence designation is intended to `_.Rÿbe used
    within a network only.  The actual use and control of that
    designation is up to each network. The Internetwork Control
    designation is intended for use by gateway control originators only.
    If the actual use of these precedence design`_.Rÿations is of concern to
    a particular network, it is the responsibility of that network to
    control the access to, and use of, those precedence designations.

  Total Length:  16 bits

    Total Length is the length of the datagram, measured in octet`_.Rÿs,
    including internet header and data.  This field allows the length of
    a datagram to be up to 65,535 octets.  Such long datagrams are
    impractical for most hosts and networks.  All hosts must be prepared
    to accept datagrams of up to 576 oct`_.Rÿets (whether they arrive whole
    or in fragments).  It is recommended that hosts only send datagrams
    larger than 576 octets if they have assurance that the destination
    is prepared to accept the larger datagrams.

    The number 576 is selected to`_.Rÿ allow a reasonable sized data block to
    be transmitted in addition to the required header information.  For
    example, this size allows a data block of 512 octets plus 64 header
    octets to fit in a datagram.  The maximal internet header is 60
    `_.Rÿoctets, and a typical internet header is 20 octets, allowing a
    margin for headers of higher level protocols.

  Identification:  16 bits

    An identifying value assigned by the sender to aid in assembling the
    fragments of a datagram.

  Flags:  3`_.Rÿ bits

    Various Control Flags.

      Bit 0: reserved, must be zero
      Bit 1: (DF) 0 = May Fragment,  1 = Don't Fragment.
      Bit 2: (MF) 0 = Last Fragment, 1 = More Fragments.

  Fragment Offset:  13 bits

    This field indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs.


                                                               [Page 13]

Internet Protocol
Specification



    The fragment offset is measured in units of 8 octets (64 bits).  The
    first fragment has offset zero.

  Time to Live:  8 bits

    This field indicates the maximum time the datagra`_.Rÿm is allowed to
    remain in the internet system.  If this field contains the value
    zero, then the datagram must be destroyed.  This field is modified
    in internet header processing.  The time is measured in units of
    seconds, but since every mo`_.Rÿdule that processes a datagram must
    decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in
    less than a second, the TTL must be thought of only as an upper
    bound on the time a datagram may exist.  The intention is to cause
    undel`_.Rÿiverable datagrams to be discarded, and to bound the maximum
    datagram lifetime.

  Protocol:  8 bits

    This field indicates the next level protocol used in the data
    portion of the internet datagram.  The values for various protocols
    are spec`_.Rÿified in "Assigned Numbers" [9].

  Header Checksum:  16 bits

    A checksum on the header only.  Since some header fields change
    (e.g., time to live), this is recomputed and verified at each point
    that the internet header is processed.

    The c`_.Rÿhecksum algorithm is:

      The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's
      complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header.  For purposes of
      computing the checksum, the value of the checksum field is zero.

    This is a simpl`_.Rÿe to compute checksum and experimental evidence
    indicates it is adequate, but it is provisional and may be replaced
    by a CRC procedure, depending on further experience.

  Source Address:  32 bits

    The source address.  See section 3.2.

  Desti`_.Rÿnation Address:  32 bits

    The destination address.  See section 3.2.

  Options:  variable

    The options may appear or not in datagrams.  They must be
    implemented by all IP modules (host and gateways`_.Rÿ).  What is optional
    is their transmission in any particular datagram, not their
    implementation.

    In some environments the security option may be required in all
    datagrams.

    The option field is variable in length.  There may be zero or `_.Rÿmore
    options.  There are two cases for the format of an option:

      Case 1:  A single octet of option-type.

      Case 2:  An option-type octet, an option-length octet, and the
               actual option-data octets.

    The option-length octet `_.Rÿcounts the option-type octet and the
    option-length octet as well as the option-data octets.

    The option-type octet is viewed as having 3 fields:

      1 bit   copied flag,
      2 bits  option class,
      5 bits  option number.

    The copied fl`_.Rÿag indicates that this option is copied into all
    fragments on fragmentation.

      0 = not copied
      1 = copied

    The option classes are:

      0 = control
      1 = reserved for future use
      2 = debugging and measurement
      3 = reserved`_.Rÿ for future use

        Compartments (C field):  16 bits

          An `_.Rÿall zero value is used when the information transmitted is
          not compartmented.  Other values for the compartments field
          may be obtained from the Defense Intelligence Agency.

        Handling Restrictions (H field):  16 bits

          T`_.Rÿhe values for the control and release markings are
          alphanumeric digraphs and are defined in the Defense
          Intelligence Agency Manual DIAM 65-19, "Standard Security
          Markings".

        Transmission Control Code (TCC field):  24 b`_.Rÿits

          Provides a means to segregate traffic and define controlled
          communities of interest among subscribers. The TCC values are
          trigraphs, and are available from HQ DCA Code 530.

        The loose source and record route (LSRR) option provides a means
        for the source of an internet datagram to supply routing
        information to be used by the gateways in forwarding the
        datagram to the destin`_.Rÿation, and to record the route
        information.

        The option begins with the option type code.  The second octet
        is the option length which includes the option type code and the
        length octet, the pointer octet, and length-3 octet`_.Rÿs of route
        data.  The third octet is the pointer into the route data
        indicating the octet which begins the next source address to be
        processed.  The pointer is relative to this option, and the
        smallest legal value for the po`_.Rÿinter is 4.

        A route data is composed of a series of internet addresses.
        Each internet address is 32 bits or 4 octets.  If the pointer is
        greater than the length, the source route is empty (and the
        recorded route full) and t`_.Rÿhe routing is to be based on the

        This procedure of replacing the source route with the recorded

        be used as a source route) means the option (and the IP header
        as a whole) remains a constant length as the datagram progresses
        through the internet.

        This option is a loose source route because the gateway or host
    `_.Rÿ    IP is allowed to use any route of any number of other
        intermediate gateways to reach the next address in the route.

        The strict source and record route (SSRR) option provides a

        information to be used by the gateways in forwarding the

        address just used, and pointer is increased by four.

`_.Rÿ        The recorded route address is the internet module's own internet
        address as known in the environment into which this datagram is

        This procedure of replacing the source route with the recorded
        route `_.Rÿ(though it is in the reverse of the order it must be in to
        be used as a source route) means the option (and the IP header
        as a whole) remains a constant length as the datagram progresses
        through the internet.

        This option is`_.Rÿ a strict source route because the gateway or host
        IP must send the datagram directly to the next address in the
        source route through only the directly connected network
        indicated in the next address to reach the next gateway or hos`_.Rÿt

        The record route option provides a means to record the route of

        The option begins with the option type code.  The second octet

        The originating host must compose this option with a large

        size of the option does not change due to adding addresses.  The
        intitial contents of the route data area must be zero.

        When an internet module routes a datagram it checks to see if
        the record route op`_.Rÿtion is present.  If it is, it inserts its
        own internet address as known in the environment into which this
        datagram is being forwarded into the recorded route begining at
        the octet indicated by the pointer, and increments the point`_.Rÿer
        by four.

        If the route data area is already full (the pointer exceeds the
        length) the datagram is forwarded without inserting the address
        into the recorded route.  If there is some room but not enough
        room for a f`_.Rÿull address to be inserted, the original datagram is
        considered to be in error and is discarded.  In either case an

        The Option Length is the number of octets in the option counting
        the type, length, pointer, and`_.Rÿ overflow/flag octets (maximum
        length 40).

        The Pointer is the number of octets from the beginning of this
        option to the end of timestamps plus one (i.e., it points to the
        octet beginning the space for next timestamp).  The `_.Rÿsmallest
        legal value is 5.  The timestamp area is full when the pointer
        is greater than the length.

        The Overflow (oflw) [4 bits] is the number of IP modules that
        cannot register timestamps due to lack of space.

        The`_.Rÿ Flag (flg) [4 bits] values are

          0 -- time stamps only, stored in consecutive 32-bit words,

          1 -- each timestamp is preceded with internet address of the
               registering entity,

          3 -- the internet address fields are`_.Rÿ prespecified.  An IP
               module only registers its timestamp if it matches its own
               address with the next specified internet address.

        The Timestamp is a right-justified, 32-bit timestamp in
        milliseconds since midn`_.Rÿight UT.  If the time is not available in
        milliseconds or cannot be provided with respect to midnight UT
        then any time may be inserted as a timestamp provided the high
        order bit of the timestamp field is set to one to indicate the
 `_.Rÿ       use of a non-standard value.

        The originating host must compose this option with a large
        enough timestamp data area to hold all the timestamp information
        expected.  The size of the option does not change due to adding

        must be zero or internet address/zero pairs.

        If the timestamp data area is already full (the pointer exceeds
        the length) the`_.Rÿ datagram is forwarded without inserting the
        timestamp, but the overflow count is incremented by one.

        If there is some room but not enough room for a full timestamp
        to be inserted, or the overflow count itself overflows, the
      `_.Rÿ  original datagram is considered to be in error and is discarded.
        In either case an ICMP parameter problem message may be sent to
        the source host [3].

        The timestamp option is not copied upon fragmentation.  It is
        carried i`_.Rÿn the first fragment.  Appears at most once in a
        datagram.

  Padding:  variable

    The internet header padding is used to ensure that the internet
    header ends on a 32 bit boundary.  The padding is zero.

3.2.  Discussion

  The implementatio`_.Rÿn of a protocol must be robust.  Each implementation
  must expect to interoperate with others created by different
  individuals.  While the goal of this specification is to be explicit
  about the protocol there is the possibility of differing
  interpre`_.Rÿtations.  In general, an implementation must be conservative
  in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.  That
  is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept
  any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not obj`_.Rÿect to technical
  errors where the meaning is still clear).

  The basic internet service is datagram oriented and provides for the
  fragmentation of datagrams at gateways, with reassembly taking place
  at the destination internet protocol module in the`_.Rÿ destination host.
  Of course, fragmentation and reassembly of datagrams within a network
  or by private agreement between the gateways of a network is also
  allowed since this is transparent to the internet protocols and the
  higher-level protocols.  `_.RÿThis transparent type of fragmentation and
  reassembly is termed "network-dependent" (or intranet) fragmentation
  and is not discussed further here.

  Internet addresses distinguish sources and destinations to the host
  level and provide a protocol fie`_.Rÿld as well.  It is assumed that each
  protocol will provide for whatever multiplexing is necessary within a
  host.

  Addressing

    To provide for flexibility in assigning address to networks and
    allow for the  large number of small to intermediate sized networks
    the interpretation of the address field is coded to`_.Rÿ specify a small
    number of networks with a large number of host, a moderate number of
    networks with a moderate number of hosts, and a large number of
    networks with a small number of hosts.  In addition there is an
    escape code for extended a`_.Rÿddressing mode.

    Address Formats:

      High Order Bits   Format                           Class
      ---------------   -------------------------------  -----
            0            7 bits of net, 24 bits of host    a

            111         escape to extended addressing mode

      A value of zero in the network field means this network.  This is
      only used in certain ICMP `_.Rÿmessages.  The extended addressing mode
      is undefined.  Both of these features are reserved for future use.

    The actual values assigned for network addresses is given in
    "Assigned Numbers" [9].

    The local address, assigned by the local net`_.Rÿwork, must allow for a
    single physical host to act as several distinct internet hosts.
    That is, there must be a mapping between internet host addresses and
    network/host interfaces that allows several internet addresses to
    correspond to one `_.Rÿinterface.  It must also be allowed for a host to
    have several physical interfaces and to treat the datagrams from
    several of them as if they were all addressed to a single host.

    Address mappings between internet addresses and addresses for
  `_.Rÿ  ARPANET, SATNET, PRNET, and other networks are described in "Address
    Mappings" [5].

  Fragmentation and Reassembly.

    The internet identification field (ID) is used together with the
    source and destination address, and the protocol fields, to`_.Rÿ identify
    datagram fragments for reassembly.

    The More Fragments flag bit (MF) is set if the datagram is not the
    last fragment.  The Fragment Offset field identifies the fragment
    location, relative to the beginning of the original unfragmen`_.Rÿted
    datagram.  Fragments are counted in units of 8 octets.  The


[Page 24]

    fragmentation strategy is designed so than an unfragmented datagram
    has all zero fragmentation information (MF = 0, fragment offset =
  `_.Rÿ  0).  If an internet datagram is fragmented, its data portion must be
    broken on 8 octet boundaries.

    This format allows 2**13 = 8192 fragments of 8 octets each for a
    total of 65,536 octets.  Note that this is consistent with the the
    datagr`_.Rÿam total length field (of course, the header is counted in the
    total length and not in the fragments).

    When fragmentation occurs, some options are copied, but others
    remain with the first fragment only.

    Every internet module must be able `_.Rÿto forward a datagram of 68
    octets without further fragmentation.  This is because an internet
    header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets.

    Every internet destination must be able to receive a datagram of 576
    octets`_.Rÿ either in one piece or in fragments to be reassembled.

    The fields which may be affected by fragmentation include:

      (1) options field
      (2) more fragments flag
      (3) fragment offset
      (4) internet header length field
      (5) total `_.Rÿlength field
      (6) header checksum

    If the Don't Fragment flag (DF) bit is set, then internet
    fragmentation of this datagram is NOT permitted, although it may be
    discarded.  This can be used to prohibit fragmentation in cases
    where the `_.Rÿreceiving host does not have sufficient resources to
    reassemble internet fragments.

    One example of use of the Don't Fragment feature is to down line
    load a small host.  A small host could have a boot strap program
    that accepts a datagram s`_.Rÿtores it in memory and then executes it.

    The fragmentation and reassembly procedures are most easily
    described by examples.  The following procedures are example
    implementations.

    General notation in the following pseudo programs: "=<" mea`_.Rÿns "less
    than or equal", "#" means "not equal", "=" means "equal", "<-" means
    "is set to".  Also, "x to y" includes x and excludes y; for example,
    "4 to 7" would include 4, 5, and 6 (but not 7).

      If the total length is less than or equal the maximum transmission
      unit then submit this datagram to the next step in datagram
      processing; otherwise cut the datagram into two fragm`_.Rÿents, the
      first fragment being the maximum size, and the second fragment
      being the rest of the datagram.  The first fragment is submitted
      to the next step in datagram processing, while the second fragment
      is submitted to this proced`_.Rÿure in case it is still too large.

      In the above procedure each fragment (except the last) was made
      the maximum allowable size.  An alternative might produce less
      than the maximum size datagrams.  For example, on`_.Rÿe could implement
      a fragmentation procedure that repeatly divided large datagrams in
      half until the resulting fragments were less than the maximum
      transmission unit size.

    An Example Reassembly Procedure

      For each datagram the b`_.Rÿuffer identifier is computed as the
      concatenation of the source, destination, protocol, and
      identification fields.  If this is a whole datagram (that is both
      the fragment offset and the more fragments  fields are zero), then
      any rea`_.Rÿssembly resources associated with this buffer identifier
      are released and the datagram is forwarded to the next step in
      datagram processing.

      If no other fragment with this buffer identifier is on hand then
      reassembly resources are `_.Rÿallocated.  The reassembly resources
      consist of a data buffer, a header buffer, a fragment block bit
      table, a total data length field, and a timer.  The data from the
      fragment is placed in the data buffer according to its fragment
      o`_.Rÿffset and length, and bits are set in the fragment block bit
      table corresponding to the fragment blocks received.

      If this is the first fragment (that is the fragment offset is
      zero)  this header is placed in the header buffer.  If this i`_.Rÿs the
      last fragment ( that is the more fragments field is zero) the
      total data length is computed.  If this fragment completes the
      datagram (tested by checking the bits set in the fragment block
      table), then the datagram is sent to `_.Rÿthe next step in datagram
      processing; otherwise the timer is set to the maximum of the
      current timer value and the value of the time to live field from
      this fragment; and the reassembly routine gives up control.

      If the timer runs o`_.Rÿut, the all reassembly resources for this
      buffer identifier are released.  The initial setting of the timer
      is a lower bound on the reassembly waiting time.  This is because
      the waiting time will be increased if the Time to Live in the
  `_.Rÿ    arriving fragment is greater than the current timer value but will
      not be decreased if it is less.  The maximum this timer value
      could reach is the maximum time to live (approximately 4.25
      minutes).  The current recommendation for the`_.Rÿ initial timer
      setting is 15 seconds.  This may be changed as experience with


                                                               [Page 27]

      value is related to the buffer capacity available and the data

      either identically or through a partial overlap, t`_.Rÿhis procedure
      will use the more recently arrived copy in the data buffer and
      datagram delivered.

  Identification

    The choice of the Identifier for a datagram is based on the need to
    provide a way to uniquely identify the fragments of `_.Rÿa particular
    datagram.  The protocol module assembling fragments judges fragments
    to belong to the same datagram if they have the same source,
    destination, protocol, and Identifier.  Thus, the sender must choose
    the Identifier to be unique `_.Rÿfor this source, destination pair and
    protocol for the time the datagram (or any fragment of it) could be
    alive in the internet.

    It seems then that a sending protocol module needs to keep a table
    of Identifiers, one entry for each destinat`_.Rÿion it has communicated
    with in the last maximum packet lifetime for the internet.

    However, since the Identifier field allows 65,536 different values,
    some host may be able to simply use unique identifiers independent
    of destination.

    `_.RÿIt is appropriate for some higher level protocols to choose the
    identifier. For example, TCP protocol modules may retransmit an
    identical TCP segment, and the probability for correct reception
    would be enhanced if the retransmission carried the`_.Rÿ same identifier
    as the original transmission since fragments of either datagram
    could be used to construct a correct TCP segment.

  Type of Service

    The type of service (TOS) is for internet service quality selection.
    The type of service `_.Rÿis specified along the abstract parameters
    precedence, delay, throughput, and reliability.  These abstract
    parameters are to be mapped into the actual service parameters of
    the particular networks the datagram traverses.

    Precedence.  An in`_.Rÿdependent measure of the importance of this
    datagram.

    Delay.  Prompt delivery is important for datagrams with this
    indication.

    Throughput.  High data rate is important for datagrams with this
    indication.




                          `_.Rÿ                                     [Page 29]

Internet Protocol
Specification



    Reliability.  A higher level of effort to ensure delivery is
    important for datagrams with `_.Rÿthis indication.

    For example, the ARPANET has a priority bit, and a choice between
    "standard" messages (type 0) and "uncontrolled" messages (type 3),
    (the choice between single packet and multipacket messages can also
    be considered a servi`_.Rÿce parameter). The uncontrolled messages tend
    to be less reliably delivered and suffer less delay.  Suppose an
    internet datagram is to be sent through the ARPANET.  Let the
    internet type of service be given as:

      Precedence:    5
      Del`_.Rÿay:         0
      Throughput:    1
      Reliability:   1

    In this example, the mapping of these parameters to those available
    for the ARPANET would be  to set the ARPANET priority bit on since
    the Internet precedence is in the upper half of `_.Rÿits range, to select
    standard messages since the throughput and reliability requirements
    are indicated and delay is not.  More details are given on service
    mappings in "Service Mappings" [8].

  Time to Live

    The time to live is set by the `_.Rÿsender to the maximum time the
    datagram is allowed to be in the internet system.  If the datagram
    is in the internet system longer than the time to live, then the
    datagram must be destroyed.

    This field must be decreased at each point that `_.Rÿthe internet header
    is processed to reflect the time spent processing the datagram.
    Even if no local information is available on the time actually
    spent, the field must be decremented by 1.  The time is measured in
    units of seconds (i.e. th`_.Rÿe value 1 means one second).  Thus, the
    maximum time to live is 255 seconds or 4.25 minutes.  Since every
    module that processes a datagram must decrease the TTL by at least
    one even if it process the datagram in less than a second, the TTL
    `_.Rÿmust be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may
    exist.  The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be
    discarded, and to bound the maximum datagram lifetime.

    Some higher level reliable connection protocols are bas`_.Rÿed on
    assumptions that old duplicate datagrams will not arrive after a
    certain time elapses.  The TTL is a way for such protocols to have
    an assurance that their assumption is met.

  Options

    Th`_.Rÿe options are optional in each datagram, but required in
    implementations.  That is, the presence or absence of an option is
    the choice of the sender, but each internet module must be able to
    parse every option.  There can be several options pre`_.Rÿsent in the
    option field.

    The options might not end on a 32-bit boundary.  The internet header
    must be filled out with octets of zeros.  The first of these would
    be interpreted as the end-of-options option, and the remainder as
    interne`_.Rÿt header padding.

    Every internet module must be able to act on every option.  The
    Security Option is required if classified, restricted, or
    compartmented traffic is to be passed.

  Checksum

    The internet header checksum is recomputed if t`_.Rÿhe internet header is
    changed.  For example, a reduction of the time to live, additions or
    changes to internet options, or due to fragmentation.  This checksum
    at the internet level is intended to protect the internet header
    fields from tra`_.Rÿnsmission errors.

    There are some applications where a few data bit errors are
    acceptable while retransmission delays are not.  If the internet
    protocol enforced data correctness such applications could not be
    supported.

  Errors

    Inte`_.Rÿrnet protocol errors may be reported via the ICMP messages [3].

3.3.  Interfaces

  The functional description of user interfaces to the IP is, at best,
  fictional, since every operating system will have different
  facilities.  Consequently, we must war`_.Rÿn readers that different IP
  implementations may have different user interfaces.  However, all IPs
  must provide a certain minimum  set of services to guarantee that all
  IP implementations can support the same protocol hierarchy.  This
  section specif`_.Rÿies the functional interfaces required of all IP
  implementations.

  Internet protocol interfaces on one side to the local network and on
  the other side to either a higher level protocol or an application
  program.  In the following, the higher level `_.Rÿprotocol or application


                                                               [Page 31]

Specification



  program (or even a gateway program) will be `_.Rÿcalled the "user" since it
  is using the internet module.  Since internet protocol is a datagram
  protocol, there is minimal memory or state maintained between datagram
  transmissions, and each call on the internet protocol module by the
  user supplies`_.Rÿ all information necessary for the IP to perform the
  service requested.

  An Example Upper Level Interface

  The following two example calls satisfy the requirements for the user
  to internet protocol module communication ("=>" means returns):

  SEND`_.Rÿ (src, dst, prot, TOS, TTL, BufPTR, len, Id, DF, opt => result)

    where:

      src = source address
      dst = destination address
      prot = protocol
      TOS = type of service
      TTL = time to live
      BufPTR = buffer pointer

    Note that the precedence is included in the TOS and `_.Rÿthe
    security/compartment is passed as an option.

  RECV (BufPTR, prot, => result, src, dst, TOS, len, opt)

    where:

      BufPTR = buffer pointer
      prot = protocol
      result = response

  When the user sends a datagram, it executes the SEND ca`_.Rÿll supplying
  all the arguments.  The internet protocol module, on receiving this
  call, checks the arguments and prepares and sends the message.  If the
  arguments are good and the datagram is accepted by the local network,
  the call returns successfu`_.Rÿlly.  If either the arguments are bad, or
  the datagram is not accepted by the local network, the call returns
  unsuccessfully.  On unsuccessful returns, a reasonable report must be
  made as to the cause of the problem, but the details of such reports
 `_.Rÿ are up to individual implementations.

  When a datagram arrives at the internet protocol module from the local
  network, either there is a pending RECV call from the user addressed
  or there is not.  In the first case, the pending call is satisfied by
`_.Rÿ  passing the information from the datagram to the user.  In the second
  case, the user addressed is notified of a pending datagram.  If the
  user addressed does not exist, an ICMP error message is returned to
  the sender, and the data is discarded.

  `_.RÿThe notification of a user may be via a pseudo interrupt or similar
  mechanism, as appropriate in the particular operating system
  environment of the implementation.

  A user's RECV call may then either be immediately satisfied by a
  pending datagram, `_.Rÿor the call may be pending until a datagram arrives.

  The source address is included in the send call in case the sending
  host has several addresses (multiple physical connections or logical
  addresses).  The internet module must check to see that the`_.Rÿ source
  address is one of the legal address for this host.

  An implementation may also allow or require a call to the internet
  module to indicate interest in or reserve exclusive use of a class of
  datagrams (e.g., all those with a certain value in `_.Rÿthe protocol
  field).

  This section functionally characterizes a USER/IP interface.  The
  notation used is similar to most procedure of function calls in high
  level languages, but this usage is not meant to rule out trap type
  service calls (e.g., S`_.RÿVCs, UUOs, EMTs), or any other form of
  interprocess communication.

  This is a internet datagram in version 4 of internet protocol; the
  internet header consists of five 32 bit words, and the total length of
  the datagram is 21 octets.  This datagram is a complete da`_.Rÿtagram (not
  a fragment).

APPE`_.RÿNDIX B:  Data Transmission Order

The order of transmission of the header and data described in this
document is resolved to the octet level.  Whenever a diagram shows a
group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal
order in whic`_.Rÿh they are read in English.  For example, in the following
diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered.

                                    
    0                   1                   2                   3

                      Transmission Order of Bytes

                               Figure 10.

Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the
diagram is the high order or most significant bit.  That is, the bit
la`_.Rÿbeled 0 is the most significant bit.  For example, the following
diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).

                                    
                            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

                               Figure 11.

Similarly, whenever a multi-octet field represents a numeric quantity
the left most bit of th`_.Rÿe whole field is the most significant bit.  When
a multi-octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is
transmitted first.

          of a Network field and a Local Address field.

internet datagram`_.Rÿ
          The unit of data exchanged between a pair of internet modules
          (includes the internet header).

internet fragment
          A portion of the data of an internet datagram with an internet
          header.

Local Address
          The ad`_.Rÿdress of a host within a network.  The actual mapping of
          an internet local address on to the host addresses in a
          network is quite general, allowing for many to one mappings.

MF
          The More-Fragments Flag carried in the internet `_.Rÿheader flags
          field.

module
          An implementation, usually in software, of a protocol or other
          procedure.

more-fragments flag
          A flag indicating whether or not this internet datagram
          contains the end of an inte`_.Rÿrnet datagram, carried in the
          internet header Flags field.

NFB
          The Number of Fragment Blocks in a the data portion of an
          internet fragment.  That is, the length of a portion of data
          measured in 8 octet units.

          An eight bit byte.

Options
          The internet header Options field may contain several options,
          and each option may be several octets in length.

Padding
          The internet header Pa`_.Rÿdding field is used to ensure that the
          data begins on 32 bit word boundary.  The padding is zero.

Protocol

          protocol built on UDP.

Time to Live
          An internet header field which indicates t`_.Rÿhe upper bound on
          how long this internet datagram may exist.

TOS
          Type of Service

Total Length
          The internet header field Total Length is the length of the
